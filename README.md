# bioinformatics-full-stack-app

Variant Explorer is a full-stack web application that allows users to query human genetic variants and view consolidated annotation and clinical evidence in a single, interpretable interface. The goal of this project is to bridge bioinformatics workflows with production-grade web development by demonstrating how genomic data can be retrieved, normalized, and presented in a way that is both scientifically meaningful and user-friendly.

The application is designed for students, researchers, and analysts who want a lightweight way to explore variants without navigating multiple databases independently.
